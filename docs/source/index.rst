*Massive Black-Hole Binary Population Synthesis for Gravitational Wave Calculations ≋●≋●≋*

`holodeck on github <https://github.com/nanograv/holodeck>`_

This package is aimed at providing a comprehensive framework for MBH binary population synthesis.  The framework includes modules to perform pop synth using a variety of methodologies to get a handle on both statistical and systematic uncertainties.  Currently, binary populations can be synthesized based on: cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (Illustris), semi-analytic/semi-empirical models (SAMs), and observational catalogs of local galaxies and/or quasars.

Installation
============

The `holodeck` framework is currently under substantial, active development.  It will not available on `pypi` (`pip`) or via `conda` install until it has stabilized.  Currently `holodeck` requires `python >= 3.8` (See `Python Versions`_ below), and tests are run on versions `3.8`, `3.9`, `3.10`.  To build directly from source:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/nanograv/holodeck.git
    pip install -e holodeck -r holodeck/requirements-dev.txt

The `pip install -e` command builds the package in 'editable' mode, so that changes to the source code are reflected in the package when it's imported from external python code.  The `-r holodeck/requirements-dev.txt` install not only the standard package requirements, but also the 'development' requirements.

Currently tests are run on python versions 3.8, 3.9, 3.10.  Ensure that you are using version >= 3.8

To uninstall the package, you can run `pip uninstall holodeck`.

Python Versions
---------------

If you do not currently use one of these python versions, it is strongly recommended to use `anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution>`_ which makes managing/using multiple python versions very easy.  `anaconda` is available through most OS package managers, for example `homebrew` on macos.  With `anaconda` installed, you can create a new conda environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda create -n py39_holodeck python=3.9     # create a new environment named `py39_holodeck` with python version 3.9
   conda activate py39_holodeck                 # activate the new conda environment
   pip install -e . -r requirements-dev.txt     # install holodeck from within the holodeck top-level directory

All conda environments currently active on your system can be listed with `conda info -e`.  To deactivate an environment, use the command `conda deactivate`.


Development & Contributions
===========================

This project is being led by the `NANOGrav <http://nanograv.org/>`_ Astrophysics Working Group.

Details on contributions and the mandatory code of conduct can be found in `CONTRIBUTING.md <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanograv/holodeck/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_.

To-do items and changes to the API should be included in the `CHANGELOG.md <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nanograv/holodeck/docs/CHANGELOG.md>`_.

Contributions are not only welcome but encouraged, anywhere from new modules/customizations to bug-fixes to improved documentation and usage examples.  The git workflow is based around a `main` branch which is intended to be (relatively) stable and operational, and an actively developed `dev` branch.  New development should be performed in "feature" branches (made off of the `dev` branch), and then incorporated via pull-request (back into the `dev` branch).

Formatting
----------

New code should generally abide by PEP8 formatting, with `numpy` style docstrings.  Exceptions are:

* lines may be broken at either 100 or 120 columns

Notebooks
---------

Please strip all notebook outputs before commiting notebook changes.  The `[nbstripout](https://github.com/kynan/nbstripout)` package is an excellent option to automatically strip all notebook output only in git commits (i.e. it doesn't change your notebooks in-place).  You can also use `nbconvert` to strip output in place: `jupyter nbconvert --clear-output --inplace <NOTEBOOK-NAME>.ipynb`.

To install `nbstripout` for the `holodeck` git package, make sure you're in the `holodeck` root directory and run:

.. code-block:: bash

  pip install --upgrade nbstripout    # install nbstripout
  nbstripout --install                # install git hook in current repo only


Test Suite
----------

**Before submitting a pull request, run `$ tox` to execute the full suite of builtin tests.**

(Unit)tests should be developed in two ways: for simple functions/behaviors, standard unit-tests can be placed in the `holodeck/tests/` directory.  More complex functionality should be tested in notebooks (in `notebooks/`) where they can also be used as demonstrations/tutorials for that behavior.  The python script `scripts/convert_notebook_tests.py` converts target notebooks into python scripts in the `holodeck/tests/converted_notebooks` directory, which can then be run by `pytest`.  The script `scripts/tester.sh` will run the conversion script and then run `pytest`, for help and usage information, run `$ scripts/tester.sh -h`.

The full test suite can be run on all supported python versions using `tox`.  In the base package directory, simply run `$ tox` and it will use `conda` to create environments and run tests on all supported python versions.  To include the notebook tests, make sure to run `scripts/tester.sh` before running `tox`.
